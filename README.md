# PID-Control-of-motor-
A miniature test RIG implementing the PID control of DC motor
was done. The DC shaft position when disturbed externally, would
try to attain its set position (vertical position) by sensing current
position using optical encoder. The set position is reached based
on the Kp, Ki, Kd values provided by the user manually using
potentiometer.
